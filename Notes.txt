In this session we learnt some basics of how to excel the typing speed by using various 
keyboard shortcuts and commands in Intellij IDEA tool.

Day 2 & 3 01 & 02 
Git:
- Git is a smart helper for coders, tracking changes in code for smooth collaboration.
- Developed by Linus Torvalds, it manages work among multiple contributors.

Importance of Git:
- Enables collaboration on projects.
- Tracks code changes for issue identification and resolution.
- Facilitates version control, managing different software versions.

branching:
- Involves creating separate development lines for features or bug fixes.
- Isolates changes, preventing interference until integration.

merging:
- Combines changes from one branch into another.
- Typically merges feature branches into the main branch.

Types of Version Control:
- Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
- Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

Difference Between Distributed and Centralized VCS:
- Centralized VCS manages version control on a central server.
- Distributed VCS like Git provides flexibility with complete copies for each developer.

Why Git is Required:
- Enables collaborative development.
- Efficient version control.
- Supports branching, merging, and collaboration.
what is a Repo:
- A storage space for project history and files, often hosted on platforms like GitHub.

Types of Repos
- Public: Accessible by anyone.
- Private: Limited access, typically for sensitive projects.

working Directory:

Staging Area:
- An intermediate area where changes are marked for the next commit.

Commit History:
- A record of all commits with changes, authors, and timestamps.

Origin Repository:
- The default name for the remote repository where your local repository connects.

fork:
- Creates a personal copy of someone else's project on GitHub.

Difference Between Centralized and Distributed VCS:
- Centralized VCS has a single central repository.
- Distributed VCS gives each user a complete repository copy.

Difference Between Git and GitHub:
- Git is a version control system.
- GitHub hosts Git repositories with collaboration features.

trunk-Based vs. Branch-Based Development:
- Trunk-Based integrates code frequently into the main branch.
- Branch-Based uses feature branches and merges them later.

feature Toggle:
- A mechanism to enable or disable features during runtime without changing the code.

Scenario for Branch-Based and Trunk-Based Development:
- Branch-Based is suitable for large, long-term changes.
- Trunk-Based is suitable for frequent, smaller changes.
